HDR-VDP-2: A calibrated visual metric for visibility and quality
predictions in all luminance conditions

This directory contains matlab code of the HDR-VDP-2 - a visual
difference predictor for high dynamic range images. This is the
successor of the original HDR-VDP.

Always check for the latest release of the metric at:

http://hdrvdp.sourceforge.net/

The current version and the list of changes can be found in the
ChangeLog.txt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
To install the metric:

1. Download matlabPyrTools from http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/software.html or 
   from the hdrvdp web page (http://hdrvdp.sourceforge.net/). 

2. Add matlabPyrTools to the matlab path

   It is important to compile and installed MEX files for
   matlabPyrTools (check REAME and the MEX directory). The metric may
   return different results if matlabPyrTools is used without compiled
   MEX files.

   If you are using matlabPyrTools 1.4, you will need to install a
   patch. Refer to the project web-site
   (http://hdrvdp.sourceforge.net/) for more information.

   The matlabPyrTools downloaded from the hdrvdp web pages is already 
   patched.

3. Add the hdrvdp directory to the matlab path

-----------------------------------------------------------------
To run the metric:

Check Contents.m and the documentation for hdrvdp.m,
hdrvdp_visualize.m and hdrvdp_pix_per_deg.m
